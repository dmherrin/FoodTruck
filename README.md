# FayTown FoodTrucks

This repository includes the files for the Mobile Applications group project.

The goal of this project is to create an app that tracks food trucks in northwest Arkansas and provides information on each place of business.

To Do:

1. Data will be searchable by name, keyword, and proximity to user

2. After clicking on the food truck, a Toast will pop up including:

        -Link to website/social media/yelp page
        
        -Link to menu (if applicable)
        
        -Phone number
        
        -Pictures
        
3. Ability to save favorites that will be displayed more prominently (at top of list, different icon, etc. - something like that)
